  Hi, my name is Guosheng Feng, and I'm getting my B.S. from Harbin Institute of Technology. I'm previously studing and doing research at Harbin Massive Data Compute Center,
  unter the supervision of Prof. Hongzhi Wang. During the last few months, I interned at Tencent Technology(Shanghai) as an Assistant Computer Vision Engineer.
