    Bioinformatic analysis for structure and function of Glutamine synthetase(GS)<br/>
    (Published by The ICBB 2022 Conference on Bio-informatics) 
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    This study used homology modeling to study the structure and molecular evolution of glutamine synthetase from Antarctic sea ice bacteria, optimized the modeling results by thermodynamic simulation, and improved the modeling accuracy by 2.7%. In addition, the secondary structure and physical and chemical characteristics are also concerned by this study.

    Scanning Electron Microscopy and Metabolite Measurement Revealed the Stress Mechanism of PS-COOH Microplastics on Rhodotorula mucilaginosa AN5 <br/>
    (Preprint by The arXiv.org on Quantitative Biology)
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    In this study, the stress effect of carboxyl polystyrene on marine Rhodotorula was evaluated by growth curve drawing, metabolite measurement, optical and electron microscopic observation and metabolome analysis. Six oxidative stress substances and enzyme activities were measured and calculated.

    Feasibility study on the application of biological flocculation technology in nitrogen removal of marine circulating water aquaculture<br/>
    (Published by TheTech wind on Environmental Engineering)
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    The feasibility of bioflocculation technology in circulating mariculture was explored, and some water quality indexes and survival state of sea cucumber were measured.The use of bioflocculant reduced the free nitrogen by more than 8%, which was measured by spectrophotometry.
