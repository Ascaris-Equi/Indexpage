    Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Search Based on Diverse Structures and Adaptive Recommendation <br/>
    (Submitted to IEEE. TNNLS Journal)
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    We propose a multi-objective method to automatically search for the Pareto Optimal CNN model. By utilizing a more flexible outer level structure and diverse network cells, and at the same time proposing a Model Fast Evaluation Strategy and Self-Adaptive Recommendation, our framework could find a CNN model that reaches 98.1% accuracy on cifar10 dataset with only 2.3M parameters
