    This study used homology modeling to study the structure and molecular evolution of glutamine synthetase from Antarctic sea ice bacteria, optimized the modeling results by thermodynamic simulation, and improved the modeling accuracy by 2.7%. In addition, the secondary structure and physical and chemical characteristics are also concerned by this study.
